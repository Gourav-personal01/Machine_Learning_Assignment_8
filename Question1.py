# # Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in
# # predicting the quality of wine.

# # Answer - 

# Fixed Acidity:
# Importance: Fixed acidity refers to the non-volatile acids in the wine

# Volatile Acidity:
# Importance: Volatile acidity represents the presence of volatile acids (e.g., acetic acid) in the wine

# Citric Acid:
# Importance: Citric acid is a weak organic acid found in small quantities in wines.

# Residual Sugar:
# Importance: Residual sugar refers to the amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation. 

# Chlorides:
# Importance: Chlorides represent the presence of salts in the wine.

# Free Sulfur Dioxide:
# Importance: Free sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative in wines to prevent spoilage. 

# Total Sulfur Dioxide:
# Importance: Total sulfur dioxide includes both free and bound sulfur dioxide. 

# Density:
# Importance: Density is a measure of the wine's mass per unit volume. 

# pH:
# Importance: pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the wine. It can influence the wine's stability and sensory properties. Proper pH is essential for balanced wine.

# Sulphates:
# Importance: Sulphates, often in the form of potassium sulfate, can contribute to the wine's flavor stability and clarity. They may also play a role in enhancing wine aroma and taste.

# Alcohol:
# Importance: Alcohol content significantly affects the wine's body, mouthfeel, and overall balance. It can impact the wine's perceived quality and style.

# Quality (Target Variable):
# Importance: The wine quality rating, typically on a scale from 3 to 9, is the target variable to be predicted.
